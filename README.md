# Project Description
This project involves the implementation of the `find()` and `insert()` operations for three different types of binary search trees: BSTs, RBTs, and AVL trees. The latter two are balanced trees, which means they adopt additional algorithms to maintain an optimal structure for future operations.

The effectiveness of these data structures regarding the search and insertion operations is analyzed by measuring the average and amortized times for executing *n* `find()` operations and *m* `insert()` operations, where *m* â‰¤ *n*.

## Binary Search Tree (BST)
The Binary Search Tree (BST) is a fundamental data structure for efficient searching and insertion operations. It follows the property that for any node, the values in its left subtree are less than the node's value, and the values in its right subtree are greater. The `find()` operation in a BST performs a binary search, while the `insert()` operation maintains the tree's order by recursively finding the appropriate position for the new node.

## Red-Black Tree (RBT)
The Red-Black Tree (RBT) is a self-balancing binary search tree. It ensures that the tree remains balanced through the use of colorings and rotations. The balancing algorithm of the RBT guarantees a logarithmic time complexity for both `find()` and `insert()` operations, resulting in efficient performance.

## AVL Tree
The AVL Tree is another type of self-balancing binary search tree. It ensures balance by maintaining a height balance factor for each node, which represents the difference between the heights of its left and right subtrees. The `find()` and `insert()` operations in an AVL tree have a time complexity of O(log *n*), making it an efficient choice for both operations.

# Performance Analysis
During the development of this project, a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of these data structures will be conducted. The average and amortized times for executing `find()` and `insert()` operations will be measured for different input sizes. This analysis will provide insights into the efficiency of each tree type and their suitability for specific use cases.

# Usage of the Project
To use the implemented algorithms for BST, RBT, and AVL trees, import the corresponding source code files into your project. Within your code, you can call the `find()` and `insert()` functions, providing the necessary parameters such as the tree structure and the values to search or insert. The results will be returned according to the respective operations.

# Contributions and Future Improvements
This project welcomes contributions and suggestions from the community. If you have ideas for optimizing the existing algorithms or implementing new features related to the search and insertion operations in BSTs, RBTs, and AVL trees, feel free to open a pull request or provide feedback through the repository's issue tracker.

Together, we can enhance and expand this project, making it a valuable resource for exploring and analyzing the effectiveness of different binary search tree variants.
